  # Trailblazer Station 14 Server Rules
  This is a roleplay server, meaning that roleplay is expected. Please take the time to read all the rules; if you are playing on the server, you are expected to follow the rules.

  [color=#ff0000]Not reading the rules is by no means an excuse to break them.
  The rules are different from many other SS14 servers. Read them, seriously.[/color]

  ## 0. Core Rules
  Core Rules apply at all times, even between rounds. Some of these rules are fully or partially zero tolerance - this means you will get immediately permanently banned upon breaking them.

  - [textlink="0.0. Admins have final say" link="0-0"]
  - [textlink="0.1. Players must act and be at least 16 years old" link="0-1"]

  ## 2. Silicon Rules
  You are only silicon if the game clearly and explicitly tells you that you are a silicon. For players who are silicons, these Silicon Rules override all roleplay rules if there is any conflict. Silicon Rules do not override core rules.

  - [textlink="2.7. Your HUD determines who is crew" link="2-7"]
  - [textlink="2.8. Harm refers to physical harm, prioritized by immediacy and likelihood" link="2-8"]
