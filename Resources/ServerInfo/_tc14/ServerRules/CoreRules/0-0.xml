  # Core Rule 0.0 - Admins have final say
  Due to the complicated nature of Space Station 14 as a game, these rules cannot cover everything. Do not try to abuse flaws or loopholes within these rules in order to gain some sort of advantage or worsen the experience of players/admins. If you are unsure of whether or not something is okay to do, feel free to ask using AHelp and don't do it unless you get permission.
  Do not try to debate rule interpretations in AHelp during the round (you may still do so after a round, for example, via admin complaint). If you consistently degrade experience of other players, you might be removed from the community.
  In some cases, admins have the right to override rules using common sense if that would be in the best interest of the round, server, or the community. This right must be explicitly invoked when used, and admins will be held fully accountable for their actions if they choose to use that right.
