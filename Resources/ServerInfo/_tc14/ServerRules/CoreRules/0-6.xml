  # Core Rule 0.6 - Only use English
  Only English is permitted, both in-character and out-of-character. You must be fluent in English enough to be able to not cause game issues, and to be able to communicate with game admins when necessary. If a game admin does not feel that you are able to communicate in English properly, they may ban you.
  Lenience is given to cases when you use just a few words (usually well-known) in your speech for RP flavor. Most of your speech still must be in English.

  ## Why
  It is impossible for admins to moderate all languages. Translation tools are unreliable for that purpose.
