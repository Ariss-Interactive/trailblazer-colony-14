  # Roleplay Rule 1.3 - Do not interfere with cryosleep/newly arrived players
  Cryosleep pods and the immediate area around them are off-limits to antagonistic activity or damage (even to antagonists). Do not prevent people from safely arriving to the planet. Do not cause people to die immediately after arriving at the planet.

  There is an exemption for antagonists that are allowed to perform mass sabotage if there is no reasonable way to limit the damage of the mass sabotage. This exemption only applies to damage that is a direct result of the mass station sabotage.

  ## Examples
  Acceptable:
  - Remodeling/disassembling the landing pod, as long as cryopod stays intact and you do not make the area more dangerous both during and after the remodel.
  - Setting up a safe security checkpoint near the cryopod.
  - Killing someone who got into the cryopod. (This may violate other rules depending on the situation)
  - Releasing a singularity which damages the cryopod. (This may violate other rules depending on the situation)
  - Moving the cryopod to a different, safe spot.

  Prohibited:
  - Making area around the cryopod uninhabitable.
  - Attacking or killing someone as soon as they leave the cryopod.
  - Placing the cryopod in a dangerous spot.
  - Making traps right near the cryopod.
