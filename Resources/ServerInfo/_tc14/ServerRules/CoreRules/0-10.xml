  # Core Rule 0.10 - Do not use LOOC or OOC to share current round information
  Local Out of Character (LOOC) and Out of Character (OOC) channel are meant for things that don't relate to the current round. Using these channels to share round info is often referred to as "IC in OOC" or "ick ock".

  ## Examples
  Things you should [color=#a4885c]not[/color] do:
  - Use LOOC to tell someone you are an antagonist.
  - Use LOOC to tell someone that your character is not lying.

  Things you could do instead:
  - Use codewords in-character.
  - Try to convince them that you are not lying in-character, or accept that you won't be able to convince them.

  Things that you're allowed to do:
  - Use LOOC to react to IC events in a way that does not match your character (OOC reaction), as long as it does not share any information unknown to others,
  - Use LOOC to thank the other player for good roleplay.
