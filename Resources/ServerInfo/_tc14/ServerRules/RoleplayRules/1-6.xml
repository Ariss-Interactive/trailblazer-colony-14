  # Roleplay Rule 1.6 - Do not stall the round
  Rounds are intended to end eventually. Don't hold a round hostage by preventing it from coming to a natural end. If a majority of players in a round want the round to end, don't prevent it from ending. Leaving the planet with the nuclear authentication disk while nuclear operatives are trying to get it is almost always considered round stalling.
