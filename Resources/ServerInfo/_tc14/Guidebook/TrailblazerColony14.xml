# Planet

Every round of TC14 is a [bold]self-contained mission[/bold] that takes place on a very, very remote planet.

Rounds typically last around [color=cyan]180 minutes[/color], but players are free to leave and join at any point during a round.

## Drop Pod
You will likely spawn on the [color=lime]Drop Pod[/color].
As soon as you leave it, you will be in a whole new environment. Your goal is to find your place in it.

## The End
Near the end of the round [color=gray](barring a [color=red][bold]nuclear disaster[/bold][/color])[/color], you will be notified via the [color=lime]shuttle announcement[/color].
When it's called, an announcement will play alerting everyone and signaling [color=cyan]the end of round in 10 minutes.[/color]
Once it arrives, it is over.

The round end is OOC information.

If you need to leave a round early, you can do so through a [color=lime]cyrogenic sleep unit[/color].
Simply going inside and leaving the game will store your belongings and ensure that they are not stolen or misused.
